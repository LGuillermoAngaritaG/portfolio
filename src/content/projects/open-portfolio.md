## Project Overview

**Open Portfolio** is a comprehensive, production-ready portfolio template that revolutionizes how developers showcase their work. Built from the ground up with SvelteKit and TypeScript, this template offers unprecedented customization through a single JSON configuration file, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.

What sets this project apart is its **complete modularity** - everything from personal information to themes, from project showcases to blog posts, can be controlled through simple configuration files. No need to dive into code unless you want to extend functionality.

**Key Value Propositions:**

- 🎯 **Zero-code customization** through JSON configuration
- 🎨 **8 built-in themes** with light/dark variants
- 📱 **4 distinct card types** for different content presentation
- ⚡ **Blazing fast performance** with SvelteKit
- 🚀 **One-click deployment** to GitHub Pages
- 📝 **Markdown-powered** content management

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **SvelteKit 2.16.0**: Modern full-stack framework providing SSR, routing, and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development ensuring robust, maintainable code
- **CSS3 with Custom Properties**: Advanced theming system with CSS variables
- **Markdown Processing**: Dynamic content rendering with `gray-matter` and `marked-highlight`
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployments

### System Architecture

The portfolio follows a **data-driven architecture** where all content flows from configuration files:

```
📁 Content Layer (JSON + Markdown)
├── portfolio-data.json (main configuration)
├── projects/*.md (project entries)
└── blogs/*.md (blog posts)
    ↓
📁 Processing Layer (SvelteKit)
├── Dynamic routing ([type]/[slug])
├── Server-side rendering
└── Component composition
    ↓
📁 Presentation Layer (4 Card Types)
├── Cards (timeline-style)
├── CardsWithLink (external links)
├── CardsWithIcons (skill categories)
└── CardsOutside (project/blog previews)
```

      "type": "cards_with_link",
      "content": [...],
      "truncation_limit": 150
    },
    {
      "title": "Projects",
      "type": "cards_outside",
      "path": "src/content/projects/"
    },
    {
      "title": "Skills",
      "type": "cards_with_icons",
      "content": [...]
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "theme": "ocean-dark",
    "name": "Your Name",
    "bio": "Your bio...",
    "cards_before_pagination": 3
  }
}

  <CardsWithLink
    sectionTitle={section.title}
    items={section.content}
    truncationLimit={section.truncation_limit}
  />
{:else if section.type === 'cards_outside'}
  <CardsOutside

export function initializeTheme(
	portfolioTheme: Theme,
	overrideUserPreference: boolean = false
): Theme {
	// Intelligent theme migration and persistence
	let themeStorage = getThemeStorage() || migrateOldStorage();
	const currentBaseTheme = getBaseTheme(portfolioTheme);

	if (themeStorage?.portfolioBaseTheme !== currentBaseTheme || overrideUserPreference) {
		const newTheme = applyDarkVariant(currentBaseTheme, isDarkTheme(themeStorage.userPreference));
		saveThemeStorage({ ...themeStorage, userPreference: newTheme });
		return newTheme;
	}

	return themeStorage?.userPreference || portfolioTheme;
}
