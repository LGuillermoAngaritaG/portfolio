## üìù Template Usage Instructions

**To use this template:**

1. **Copy this file** and rename it to your project name (e.g., `my-awesome-app.md`)
2. **Update the metadata** with your project details
3. **Replace all placeholder content** with your actual project information
4. **Add your screenshots** to the `images/` folder
5. **Set `skip: False`** when you're ready to publish
6. **Choose a `display_order`** number to control where it appears
7. **Delete this instruction section** when you're done

**Tips for great projects:**

- Focus on the **value** you created, not just the technology
- Include **specific metrics** and results when possible
- Show your **problem-solving process**, not just the final solution
- Use **clear, engaging language** that non-technical people can understand
- **Proofread** for typos and clarity

**Need inspiration?** Look at successful open-source projects and developer portfolios for ideas on how to present your work professionally.
