          * Developed multi-agent chatbots that improved performance of the llm models from 63 to 98%.
          * Developed a chat-based assistant using llms from aws bedrock. This chatbot used guardrails, a react agent and retrieval augmented generation. Improving by 87% the quality of the responses to the users.
          * Made an application that uses llms from Aws Bedrock to generate and query Graph databases, this improved the performance of Rag tasks by 70%.
